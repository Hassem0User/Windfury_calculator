# Windfury_calculator

Welcome to the Windfury_calculator.

This is based on the vanilla version from World of Warcraft.

The main goal of the project is to give the user a simply calculator for it's weapons when buff applied.
It covers both the own shaman windfury buff and the windfury totem buff for the party.

The windfury totem buff works different for each class this will help you determine which weapon benefits the most from it.





Since big weapons have very base damage but low speed swing, and their counterpart, small weapons have low base damage but high speed swing. The question is simple, which is better for the buff?

In resume:
Big weapons > High Damage, low %proc
Small weapons > Low Damage, high %proc

Are there a perfect balance? Will we know a superior weapon style? Just test it here!
